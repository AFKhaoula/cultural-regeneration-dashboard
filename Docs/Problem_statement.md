# Problem Statement: Cultural Regeneration Dashboard

## Executive Summary

City planners and heritage investment officers in postindustrial port cities lack a **data-driven decision support tool** to evaluate maritime heritage regeneration opportunities and optimize creative economy development investments. This results in:
- A lot of funding to sites with low economic potential
- Missed opportunities to attract high growth creative industries
- Lacking of strategic heritage preservation decisions

The **Cultural Regeneration Dashboard** addresses this gap by providing integrated analytics on site performance, economic impact, and cross-regional comparisons and evidence-based investment prioritization startegies.

## The Problem

### **Context: Post-Industrial Maritime Cities Face a Dilemma**

Cities like Glasgow, Liverpool, Rotterdam, and Hamburg possess **valuable maritime heritage assets** (shipyards, docks, warehouses, cranes) that are:
- Culturally significant 
- Abandoned or underutilized
- Expensive to maintain and redevelop
- Uncertain ROI on regeneration investments

**The Question Decision-Makers Face:**  
*"Which heritage sites should we invest in, what industries should we target, and how do we measure such success?"*

### **Current State: **

Today, heritage investment decisions are based on:
- **Copying blindly what worked in other places** 
- **Consultant reports not up to date** 
- **Gut feeling**

**What's Missing:**
- Real-time economic performance tracking
- Cross-site comparison capabilities
- Industry clustering analysis
- Trend visibility
- Regional benchmarking (Europe vs. emerging markets)
- Predictive indicators of success

### **The Stakes**

Poor regeneration decisions cost cities:
- **Huge sums in public investment
- **Years of delayed economic benefit
- **Lost creative industry jobs** that relocate elsewhere
- **Community displacement** 
- **Heritage loss and deterioration**

## Who Experiences This Problem?

### **Primary Users**

**1. Heritage Investment Officers**  
- **Role:** Allocate regeneration funding 
- **Pain Point:** "I need to justify why Site A gets X amount of investment instead of Site B"
- **Current Workaround:** Commission expensive consultant reports (in time and in money)
- **What They Need:** Real-time site comparison with ROI projections

**2. Urban Development Directors**  
- **Role:** Set city-wide regeneration strategy
- **Pain Point:** "Which creative industries should we recruit? What infrastructure do they need?"
- **Current Workaround:** Copy what other cities did 
- **What They Need:** Industry clustering analysis + regional best practices

**3. Economic Development Agencies**  
- **Role:** Attract creative businesses to heritage sites
- **Pain Point:** "We market to everyone and attract no one"
- **Current Workaround:** Generic "come to our city" campaigns
- **What They Need:** Data on which industries thrive at which site types

### **Secondary Users**

**4. City Councilors**  
- **Need:** Communicate ROI to citizens
- **Current Gap:** Vague promises, no measurable outcomes

**5. Cultural Organizations**  
- **Need:** Understand visitor patterns to optimize programming
- **Current Gap:** No general/global view

**6. Real Estate Developers**  
- **Need:** Assess commercial viability of heritage site projects
- **Current Gap:** No standardized benchmarks 

---

## Why Does This Problem Exist?

### **1. Data Fragmentation**
- Maritime heritage data sits in archives
- Economic impact tracked by no one
- Market comparisons require **Trade Ministry reports**
- **Result:** No one has the full picture

### **2. Legacy Processes**
- Decisions still based on manual reports
- Updates happen **annually** 
- No culture of **continuous real-time measurement**

### **3. Lack of Domain-Specific Tools**
- No pre-built dashboards for heritage regeneration use case
- Consultants build custom reports that can't be updated

### **4. No Cross-Regional Learning**
- Each city treats regeneration as unique
- Success patterns in Rotterdam aren't visible to Glasgow planners

## Proposed Solution: Cultural Regeneration Dashboard

### **What It Is**

A **self-service analytics platform** that integrates:
- 🏛️ **Maritime heritage site inventory** (location, size, status, transformation history)
- 🎨 **Creative industry mapping** (what businesses locate where, employment, revenue)
- 📊 **Economic impact metrics** (visitors, tourism revenue, local business growth)
- 🌍 **Regional benchmarking** (Europe vs. North Africa performance comparison)

### **What It Does**

**For Heritage Investment Officers:**
- Compare sites on 10+ criteria (visitor growth, revenue per sqm, industry diversity, heritage status)
- Filter to "sites most likely to succeed with £10M investment"
- Generate board-ready reports in 5 minutes instead of 5 months

**For Urban Development Directors:**
- Visualize industry clustering patterns ("Digital Media thrives near transport museums")
- Benchmark Glasgow vs. Stockholm vs. Casablanca
- Identify growth trends (which sectors are accelerating?)

**For Economic Development:**
- See which sites have "room for more" creative businesses
- Target recruitment based on data ("We need Design firms at Site 3 to complete the ecosystem")
- Track quarterly wins (new companies, job creation)

## Success Metrics: How We'll Know This Works

### **Primary Metrics (Business Impact)**

| Metric | Current State | Target (12 months) | Measurement Method |
|--------|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Decision cycle time** | 6-12 months | 2-4 weeks | Time from "Should we fund Site X?" to approval |
| **Investment ROI** | Unknown | £3 economic benefit per £1 invested | Economic impact data 3 years post-investment |
| **Site utilization rate** | 60% (2 of 5 sites underused) | 80% (4 of 5 active) | % of heritage sites with active economic activity |
| **Creative industry job growth** | Baseline (measure current) | +15% YoY | Employment data from Creative Industries table |

### **Secondary Metrics (Tool Adoption)**

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Active users** | 15+ (3 departments, 5 users each) | Shows cross-departmental value |
| **Monthly dashboard views** | 200+ | Shows regular use, not one-time lookup |
| **Reports generated** | 50+ per quarter | Shows decision-making support |
| **User satisfaction** | 4.2/5.0 | Shows tool meets needs |

## Constraints & Considerations

### **Data Limitations**
- **Sample data** used for MVP is fictional
- **Real deployment** would require integrating with:
  - City planning databases
  - Business registry APIs
  - Tourism/visitor tracking systems
  - International trade statistics

### **Political Sensitivities**
- Heritage decisions are politically charged (neighborhood interests, preservation vs. development debates)
- Dashboard must present **data objectively** without appearing to favor specific sites
- Recommendations must be defensible with clear methodology

### **Change Management**
- Users accustomed to consultant-led decision-making
- Need training on self-service analytics
- Requires cultural shift toward "data-informed" from "experience-based" decisions

---

## Why This Matters 

### **Economic Impact**

If successful in Glasgow (5 sites), this approach could:
- **Unlock  heritage assets** currently sitting idle
- **Create creative industry jobs** 
- **Generate high annual tourism revenue** 

### **Replicability**

Post-industrial port cities worldwide face this challenge:

**Market Opportunity:** If validated, dashboard could become **SaaS product for 100+ cities globally**.

### **Heritage Preservation**

Better economic data = better preservation outcomes:
- Sites with clear ROI get funded and restored

---

## Current Alternatives & Why They Fall Short

### **Alternative 1: Hire Consultants**
- Deep expertise
- high price per engagement
- 6-12 month turnaround
- Outdated the moment delivered
- Can't be updated by internal team

### **Alternative 2: Build Custom BI Reports**
- Tailored to needs
- Requires data team (3+ people)
- Not user-friendly for non-technical planners

### **Alternative 3: Excel Spreadsheets**
- Familiar tool
- Can't handle 4-table relational data
- No visualization capabilities
- Can't scale beyond 1-2 sites


**Our Solution:**  
Self-service + real-time + low cost + scalable + user-friendly

## Open Questions (To Be Resolved in Design Phase)

1. **User Interface:** Dashboard-first or report-builder approach?
2. **Update Frequency:** Real-time, weekly, or quarterly data refreshes?
3. **Access Control:** Public dashboard or restricted to city staff?
4. **Mobile Support:** Desktop-only or responsive design?
5. **Export Options:** PDF reports, Excel dumps, API access?
6. **Predictive Analytics:** Include ML models for site success prediction?
7. **Integration:** Should it push recommendations to existing project management tools?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Validate with users** (5 interviews with Heritage Officers, Development Directors)
2. **Define MVP features** (see PRD document)
3. **Build prototype** with sample Glasgow data
4. **User testing** (2 rounds, 3 users each)
5. **Iterate based on feedback**
6. **Production deployment**

## Reflection: Why I Chose This Problem

As someone transitioning from **international trade** to **product management**, I see heritage regeneration as a perfect intersection of:
- **Economic development** 
- **Data analytics** ( PM skillset—SQL, visualization, metrics)
- **Cross-regional learning** (my global perspective—Europe/North Africa comparisons)

This problem lets me demonstrate:
1. **Strategic thinking** 
2. **User empathy** 
3. **Data analysis capabilities** 
4. **Business lens** 
5. **Global perspective** (my unique differentiator)

I believe **heritage assets have immense value, but that value must be unlocked through strategic positioning, market analysis, and data driven insights. This dashboard is my attempt to bring that lens to urban planning.
