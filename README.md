## 🎯 The Problem

City planners allocate ressources without integrated data on:
- Which sites have the highest economic ROI potential
- Which creative industries thrive at which site types  
- How seasonal patterns affect visitor revenue
- What regional best practices apply from successful regeneration models

**Result:** 6-12 month decision cycles, misallocated funding, and missed opportunities to unlock post-industrial maritime assets.

---

## 💡 The Solution

A **self-service analytics dashboard** that consolidates:
- 🏛️ **Maritime heritage site inventory** (transformation history, protection status, current use)
- 🎨 **Creative industry mapping** (company locations, employment, revenue, sector diversity)
- 📊 **Economic impact metrics** (quarterly visitor trends, tourism revenue, local business growth)
- 🌍 **Regional benchmarking** (Europe vs. North Africa performance comparisons)

**Target Users:** Heritage Investment Officers, Urban Development Directors, Economic Development Agencies

## 📈 Key Insights Discovered

From analyzing Glasgow's 5 maritime heritage sites across 24 SQL queries:

| Finding | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Pacific Quay generates 2x city average revenue per visitor** | Media production facilities create dual benefit: jobs + tourism |
| **Q2-Q3 show 40-50% higher visitor counts than Q1/Q4** | Need year-round programming to smooth seasonal cashflow |
| **Sites with 4+ creative sectors generate 2x economic resilience** | Mixed clusters outperform mono-industry developments |
| **North Africa heritage tourism growing 9.2% annually vs. Europe 4.1%** | Emerging markets offer partnership + learning opportunities |
| **Govan Graving Docks: heritage protected + abandoned = high opportunity** | Priority candidate for next regeneration investment |

## 📊 Sample SQL Query & Insight

### **Query: Comprehensive Site Performance Dashboard**

```sql
-- Using CTEs to create multi-dimensional site analysis
WITH IndustryMetrics AS (
    SELECT
        ms.site_id,
        ms.site_name,
        COUNT(DISTINCT ci.industry_type) AS industry_diversity,
        SUM(ci.employees_count) AS total_employees
    FROM maritime_sites ms
    LEFT JOIN creative_industries ci ON ms.site_id = ci.site_id
    GROUP BY ms.site_id, ms.site_name
),
RevenueMetrics AS (
    SELECT
        site_id,
        SUM(tourism_revenue) / SUM(visitor_count) AS revenue_per_visitor
    FROM economic_impact
    WHERE year = 2022
    GROUP BY site_id
)
SELECT
    im.site_name,
    im.industry_diversity,
    im.total_employees,
    rm.revenue_per_visitor,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY rm.revenue_per_visitor DESC) AS efficiency_rank
FROM IndustryMetrics im
JOIN RevenueMetrics rm ON im.site_id = rm.site_id
ORDER BY efficiency_rank;
```

### **Insight:**

Sites with **4+ industry types** show **2x higher revenue per visitor** compared to single-sector sites. This demonstrates the economic value of creative industry diversity in heritage regeneration.

**Strategic Implication:** Future developments should actively recruit mixed creative clusters (media + museums + design) rather than focusing on a single industry vertical.

## 💼 About Me

**Khaoula Ait Faraji**  
Product Management Student | Transitioning from International Trade

I bring a unique combination of:
- 🌍 **Global trade perspective** (understanding cross-border markets, economic development, investment decisions)
- 📊 **Data fluency** (SQL, Power BI, analytical thinking)
- 🎯 **Product mindset** (user-centered design, strategic scoping, metrics-driven)

**Why this project?**  
Heritage regeneration sits at the intersection of economic development, data analytics, and strategic planning—exactly where my background in international trade meets my future in product management. I see heritage assets like maritime sites as similar to trade goods: they have latent value that must be unlocked through market analysis, strategic positioning, and evidence-based investment.
